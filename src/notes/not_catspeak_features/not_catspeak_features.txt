 - **Minimal setup required** ...
     ready to use after installation. No need to call any weird "init" or
     "update" functions.

 - **Cross-platform** ...
     allowing mods to work on any platform out of the box. Tried and tested on
     the VM and YYC exports on windows, as well as HTML5.

 - **Sandboxed execution environment** ...
     so modders cannot modify the sensitive parts of your game you don't want
     them to.

 - **Customisable standard library** ...
     exposing only the functions you want modders to have access to. See the
     sections on [Basic Usage] and the [Standard Library] for more
     information and examples.

 - **Performant runtime** ...
     capable of interpreting thousands of (and even tens of thousands of)
     Catspeak scripts per step. (Dependent on the complexity of your scripts.)

 - **Asynchronous execution over multiple steps** ...
     making it impossible for modders to freeze your game with infinite loops.

 - **Intelligent process manager** ...
     so no time is wasted idly waiting for new Catspeak programs to appear.

 - **Failsafes to catch unresponsive Catspeak processes**.
     Customise how this is done through the [catspeak_config] function.

 - **Call GML code from Catspeak**.
     Just use the syntax you're familiar with: `is_string(value)`. See more
     in the [Syntax] section.

 - **Call Catspeak code from GML**.
     Using the [catspeak_compile_string] and [catspeak_execute] functions.

 - **Simple, relaxed syntax** ...
     but still similar enough to GML to be familiar.

 - **Pre-compilation of scripts** ...
     to both reduce load times when initialising mods or obfuscate production
     code. (Coming Soon!)

 - **Compiler internals exposed and well-documented** ...
     in order to give power users as much control over their programs as
     possible. For examples, check out the [Advanced Usage] section.

 - **Cute name and mascot**.
