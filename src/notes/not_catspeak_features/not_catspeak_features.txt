 - **Minimal setup required** ...
     ready to use after installation. No need to call any weird "init" or
     "update" functions.

 - **Cross-platform** ...
     allowing mods to work on any platform out of the box.

 - **Sandboxed execution environment** ...
     so modders cannot modify the sensitive parts of your game you don't want
     them to.

 - **Customisable standard library** ...
     exposing only the functions you want modders to have access to.

 - **Performant runtime** ...
     capable of interpreting thousands of (and even tens of thousands of)
     Catspeak scripts per step. (Dependent on the complexity of your scripts.)

 - **Asynchronous execution over multiple steps** ...
     making it impossible for modders to freeze your game with infinite loops.

 - **Intelligent process manager** ...
     so no time is wasted idly waiting for new Catspeak programs to appear.

 - **Failsafes to catch unresponsive Catspeak processes**.

 - **Call GML code from Catspeak**.

 - **Call Catspeak code from GML**.

 - **Simple, relaxed syntax** ...
       but still similar enough to GML to be familiar.

 - **Pre-compilation of scripts** ...
     to both reduce load times when initialising mods or obfuscate production
     code. (Coming Soon!)

 - **Compiler internals exposed and well-documented** ...
     in order to give power users as much control over their programs as
     possible.

 - **Cute name and mascot**.
