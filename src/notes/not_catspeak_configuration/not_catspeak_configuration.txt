The primary method of configuring Catspeak is through the [catspeak_config]
function. This function controls global settings, such as the default
exception handler. Please read the documentation for the function to get an
in-depth description of what each option does.

As an example, to change the global exception handler for Catspeak programs
you would use the [catspeak_config] function like so:
```
catspeak_config({
    "exceptionHandler": function(error) {
        show_debug_message("A Catspeak error occurred!");
        show_debug_message(error);
    },
});
```
This will update the global exception handler, so that if an error occurs a
message will be displayed in the output window instead of crashing the game.
