The primary method of configuring Catspeak is through the [catspeak_config]
function. This function controls global settings, such as the default
exception handler. **Please read** the documentation for [catspeak_config] to
get an in-depth description of what each option does.

To configure multiple options, you can pass in both simultaneously:
```
catspeak_config({
    "frameAllocation": 0.25, // only run Catspeak for 25% of a frame

    "processTimeLimit": 5,   // all processes can run for 5 seconds before
                             // being forced to stop
});
```

NOTE: There is currently no way to get the current value for a configuration
      option. This will either be done using a new function, or by passing
      the option name as a string to the [catspeak_config] function.
